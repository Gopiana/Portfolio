              I'm an enthusiastic Frontend Developer with four months of hands-on experience building responsive and user-friendly websites. I specialize in React.js and have a growing passion for creating clean, interactive, and accessible web interfaces. During this time, Iâ€™ve worked on real-time projects that helped me strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

             <p style={{fontSize:"17px"}}> I'm eager to continue learning and improving through practical experience, and I'm excited to take on an internship where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with a skilled team, and grow as a developer.
